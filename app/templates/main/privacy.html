            </p>
            
            <h3 class="mt-5">1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>
                We collect the following information when you use the platform:

            <h3 class="mt-5">2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>
                Your information is used solely for the operation of the Analyst Performance Tracker:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To authenticate your access to the platform.</li>
                <li>To send you password‑setup and password‑reset emails.</li>
                <li>To calculate and display your personal performance metrics.</li>
                <li>To enable administrators to manage users and uploads.</li>
                <li>To maintain security and detect unauthorized access.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="mt-5">3. Data Storage and Security</h3>
            <p>
                All data is stored in a secure SQLite database located on the application server. Access to the database
                is restricted to the application itself and authorized administrators. Passwords are hashed using
                industry‑standard bcrypt hashing; we never store plain‑text passwords.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="mt-5">4. Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>
                We do not share your personal information with any third parties, except as required by law.
                Aggregated, anonymized performance statistics may be shared within the Prague Club of Investors
                for internal evaluation purposes.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="mt-5">5. Your Rights</h3>
            <p>
                You have the right to:

                <li>Request correction of inaccurate data.</li>
                <li>Request deletion of your account and associated data (subject to legitimate business needs).</li>
            </ul>
