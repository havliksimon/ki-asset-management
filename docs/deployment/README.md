## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

### Security
- [ ] `SECRET_KEY` is a cryptographically secure random value (32+ bytes)
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (never committed)
- [ ] Repository is set to **Private** on GitHub
- [ ] Admin password is strong (12+ characters)

### Configuration
- [ ] `FLASK_ENV=production` is set
- [ ] `USE_LOCAL_SQLITE=False` for PostgreSQL
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` configured (neon.tech)
- [ ] Email configured (SendGrid for Render, SMTP for others)

### Domain (Optional)
- [ ] Custom domain configured (if using)
- [ ] SSL certificate enabled (HTTPS)

### Monitoring
- [ ] Ping service configured (for Render free tier)
- [ ] Log monitoring setup

---

## 🔄 Post-Deployment Workflow

Once deployed, updating is easy:

```bash
# 1. Make changes locally
# Edit files, test locally

# 2. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main

# 3. Auto-deploy happens automatically!
# Render/Koyeb will detect the push and redeploy
```

**Deployment takes:** 2-3 minutes

## 💰 Cost Estimates

### Free Tier (Sufficient for 20-50 users)

| Service | Provider | Monthly Cost |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Web Hosting | Render | $0 |
| Web Hosting | Koyeb | $0 |
| Database | neon.tech | $0 |
| Email | SendGrid | $0 (100 emails/day) |
| Domain (optional) | Various | $10-15/year |
| **Total** | | **$0-15/year** |

### When to Upgrade

Consider paid tiers when:
- Database exceeds 500MB (neon.tech free limit)
- You need more than 20 concurrent connections
- Build minutes exceed 500/month (Render)
- Cold start delays become problematic
- You need custom domain with SSL

---

## 🆘 Deployment Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Application failed to start"

**Solution:**
1. Check logs in platform dashboard
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is configured
4. Check `DATABASE_URL` is correct

### Issue: "Database connection failed"

**Solution:**
1. Verify neon.tech database is active (not suspended)
2. Check `DATABASE_URL` format
3. Ensure `USE_LOCAL_SQLITE=False`
4. Try reconnecting string from neon.tech dashboard

### Issue: "Build failed"

**Solution:**
1. Verify `requirements.txt` is in repo
2. Check all dependencies are listed
3. Test locally: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Issue: "404 Not Found"

**Solution:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment
2. Check service shows "Live" status
3. Try `https://` not `http://`
