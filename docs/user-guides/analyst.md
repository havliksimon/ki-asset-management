## 📊 Understanding Your Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators

| Metric | What It Means | Good Value |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Win Rate** | % of your picks that made money | > 50% |
| **Average Return** | Average profit/loss per pick | Positive |
| **Median Return** | Middle value (less skewed by outliers) | Positive |
| **Total Analyses** | Number of analyses you've done | Varies |
| **Approved Count** | Analyses that passed board vote | Varies |

### Benchmark Comparisons

Your performance is compared against:

- **S&P 500 (SPY)** - US large-cap stocks
- **FTSE All-World (VT)** - Global stock market

**How to read it:**
- **Positive spread** = You outperformed the benchmark
- **Negative spread** = Benchmark outperformed you

## 🔍 Understanding Analyses

### Analysis Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Scheduled** | Planned presentation |
| **On Watchlist** | Under review |
| **Approved** | Board voted to purchase |
| **Rejected** | Board voted against |
| **Other** | Non-stock event |

### How Returns Are Calculated

```
Return % = (Current Price - Price at Analysis) / Price at Analysis × 100
```

**Example:**
- You analyzed Apple at $150
- Current price is $180
- Return = (180 - 150) / 150 × 100 = **20%**

### Annualized Returns

For holdings over 1 year, returns are annualized:
```
Annualized Return = (Total Return + 1)^(1/Years) - 1
```

This allows fair comparison between short and long-term holdings.

## 🆘 Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why is my return different from what I calculated?**  
A: We use closing prices on analysis date and most recent available price. Slight timing differences are normal.

**Q: What counts as a "win"?**  
A: Any analysis with positive return percentage.

**Q: Why is my analysis not showing?**  
A: Only "Approved" status analyses count toward performance. Check with admin about board vote status.

**Q: Can I see other analysts' performance?**  
A: Admin can see all, but analysts typically see only their own. Check with your admin about visibility settings.

**Q: How often is data updated?**  
A: Stock prices update when admin runs recalculation (typically daily or weekly).

**Q: What's the difference between Average and Median return?**  
A: Average can be skewed by one very good or bad pick. Median shows the middle value and is often more representative.
